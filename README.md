Pub Crawl: London
=================

**Hello,** my name is Dan Hough. I'm a Developer from London and I'm creating this iOS app to help late-night revellers (or weekend revellers, I'm not fussy) use London's Underground Network as a Pub/Bar crawl route.

I plan to release it for free on the App Store with just two lines available, with additional line being sold at price tier 1 (69p in the UK) or all of them for price tier 3 (Â£1.99 in the uk).

Why do I want to use IAP? Well, I'm going to write a blog about that over at [my personal site](http://danhough.com), but in short: I've worked hard on it, I think it's pretty good and it's worth spending a little bit of money on it.

If you're interested in contributing, I would accept you with open arms. However, I can't promise I will be able to reimburse you for any of your work if/when I make any money from it, so don't get involved for financial gain.

Thanks for reading.
